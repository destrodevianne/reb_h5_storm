!Instructions for mixing: *-Use alchemist chest ballot boxes for the
missing-* *1.Work with the ballot paper*%% Place the stone mixing
(Mixing System stone) in any boxes. *2. Choice ingredients*%% Select the
type and quantity of ingredients for reagents formula and place them in
the wastepaper basket. *3.Select catalysts*%% Select the type and number
of catalysts to reagents formula and place them in the wastepaper
basket. Be careful, if you press the wrong catalysts, the mixing will be
unsuccessful and all components, placed in the wastepaper basket
disappear. *4. Setting the temperature*%% Exist of three temperature
regime: Temperature №1: "Salamander" the most safe, and mix of course
manage, but only the few reagent is received. With temperature regime №2
"Ifrit" exist some risk which materials will be annihilated, but in
successful mix more reagents is received. Temperature №3 "Phoenix"
highest and has highest chance failed mix, but if everything will pass
successfully - will produce greatest quantity of reagents. *5. Mixing
ingredients*%% As only the correct type and quantity of ingredients and
the catalyst will be placed in the wastepaper basket and will be
equipped with temperature, mixing will begin. If the formula is correct
and ingredients is not global warming, the desirable increase the
whiteness will be created. [player_help tutorial/6317.htm|Back]
