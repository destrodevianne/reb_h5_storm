	Diary of Lydia:
	<br> Dark Deeps
	<br>
	<br> Starlight reflected in his smile.
	<br> He speaks of courage, but I do not know where or even who I
	am!
	<br> Can crazy people can be courageous? Who knows?
	<br> His laughter is heard, and again, the word courage. Other
	words, but they are in another language, I do not understand.
	<br> Dark Magician with his smile speaks softly to me, holding my
	hands in the dark night.
	<br> Courage. Courage. Courage. Nothing else matters.
	<br> My ceremony is still ready! What's going on here so late?
