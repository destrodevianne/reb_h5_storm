Lottery Ticket Seller: Here is how to play the lottery: Select five
numbers between 1 and 20. Your prize is determined by how many winning
numbers you match. First place goes to those who pick all five winning
numbers. First place prize amount is

Second place goes to those who pick four out of the five winning
numbers. Second place prize amount is

. Third place goes to those who pick three out of the five winning
numbers. Third place prize amount is
<font color="LEVEL"> %prize3% adena.</font>
. Those who pick two or less of the winning number may receive

The prize money for each category will be divided equally amongst
winners. If there are no winners in any category, those winnings are
transferred to the next jackpot. Lottery tickets are sold on a weekly
basis, starting at 7:10 pm every Saturday until 6:50 pm the following
Saturday. The winning numbers are announced at 7:00 pm every Saturday.
All times are subject to change. I wish you luck! Enjoy the lottery.
