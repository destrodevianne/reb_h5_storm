!Captain Ðœatias: People must not be circulated false rumours! I have
heard them all before ... fans devil, vampire, and the like ... Food
parcels by bosh! This city is well protected by our royal guards! Don't
worry! Those who circulates this lie? If you hear any, speaking such
debris, immediately tell me! I know that you are not least rhetorically,
to listen to this! Rich people in this town have a very dim view of such
unfounded panic! In your place, I would be heeded by my words!
