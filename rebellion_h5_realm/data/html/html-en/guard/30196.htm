!Captain Moyn: Welcome to the Oren, rad Adventurer. I Моун, am on our
Lord, охраняю city. As Oren perfet close to competitor Aden kingdom, the
kingdom Elmor, the guardian Oren is constantly on the alert. This can
deliver travelers like you trouble, but you must understand us
correctly. In fact, people here are the same as in Elmore. This is not
important whether we use wood for their own needs or not. I can even
name ten such in Elmore immediately, ha ha! You can see the castle on
the northern hill? This is the lock Oren. Ккаждыи times by looking at
him, I pray that the people in it never knew grief, and that the
inhabitants Elmore were aware of its power.
